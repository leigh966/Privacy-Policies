# Privacy Policy

## What data is collected?
If you choose to input a name when starting a new game, you are consenting for the following data to be uploaded to the leaderboard server:
- Your name or nickname as input
- The number of jumps it took for you to complete the game
- The amount of active playtime it took for you to complete the game
- The number of times you died in your playthrough

If you choose instead to click "No Thanks" when presented with the option to choose a name for the leaderboard, no data will be transmitted from your device. The following data may still be captured within the app but will not be shared with the developers, other users or any other 3rd party:
- The number of jumps it took for you to complete the game
- The amount of active playtime it took for you to complete the game
- The number of times you died in your playthrough

## How is collected data used?
In the case that you use the leaderboard, your jumps, deaths, time and name will be uploaded to the leaderboard server and presented to other users when they open the leaderboard. This data is not used for any other purpose than to provide a leaderboard to encourage competitive replaying of the game. Your name that you choose for the leaderboard can be as identifyable or not identifyable as per your preference.

If you are not having results uploaded to the leaderboard, your jumps, deaths and time may still be captured but are currently not used in any way and will never be transmitted off your device.
